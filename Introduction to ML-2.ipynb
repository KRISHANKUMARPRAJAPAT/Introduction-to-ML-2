    "To reduce overfitting in machine learning models, you can employ several techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **More Data:** Increasing the size of the training dataset can help the model generalize better, as it gets exposed to a wider range of examples and reduces the chances of fitting noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Cross-Validation:** Use techniques like k-fold cross-validation to assess the model's performance on multiple subsets of the data. This helps in identifying if the model is consistently overfitting or if it's generalizing well.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  **Feature Selection:** Carefully choose relevant and informative features while excluding irrelevant or noisy ones. This simplifies the model and reduces the risk of fitting noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Regularization:** Introduce regularization techniques like L1 and L2 regularization. These penalize overly complex models and discourage large weights, encouraging the model to be simpler and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early Stopping:** Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop the training process when the performance starts to degrade. This helps prevent the model from overfitting to the training data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Augmentation:** Augmenting the training data by applying transformations or perturbations can create more diverse examples, further reducing overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Dropout:** In neural networks, using dropout layers during training randomly deactivates certain neurons, which prevents the network from becoming overly reliant on specific neurons and improves generalization.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ensemble Methods:** Combining predictions from multiple models (e.g., bagging or boosting) can often reduce overfitting by leveraging the diversity of individual models.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reduce Model Complexity:** Use simpler model architectures or reduce the number of layers/neurons in neural networks to avoid overfitting.\n",
